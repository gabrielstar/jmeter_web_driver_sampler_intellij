# jmeter_web_driver_sampler_intellij
This projects contains a recipe for writing jmeter WebDriverSampler directly in Intellij IDE 

You can develop sampler in IDE and make sure it is fully transferable to Jmeter.

Contents:


````wds/

        **wds.jmx** - jmeter scenario
        **wds_jmeter.groovy** - version of WDS sampler for copy-paste to jmeter
  src/
        **wds.groovy** - jmeter sampler with necessary mocks alloweing to use IntelliJ IDE (or any other)
        **convert.groovy** - converter to clean up wds.groovy to a version understandable by jmeter
        **chromedriver.exe** - browser driver used in this repo (update to your browser version)'''`
